This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it''s never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera''s slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant.','28-FEB-2022');
insert into Review values (89,'lesterlo','Matches the brilliance of the first film',10,'Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story. Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director''s cuts.','25-MAR-2022');

Not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways,) but Aliens is, I would class it as one of the best movies of all time, a cinematic Masterpiece which seems to improve with age. It''s a space horror, which is dramatic, action packed and funny at times.','17-JUN-2022');

Even in 1979, Ellen Ripley was what those wannabes today want to recreate: a strong, yet believable female character with a real challenge and a highly competent movie around her. Go watch this movie!','02-JUL-2022');

Through it''s well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are.','07-JUL-2022');
insert into Review values (44,'lesterlo','A film that shows the true cost of war',10,'I was nearly moved to tears by this film''s brave treatment of such critical subject matter. "Grave of the Fireflies" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. It''s brave, it''s not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.','19-JAN-2022');

The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century.','29-MAR-2022');

This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career.

I think Kubrick did a great job with the visuals and the settings. Beyond that, it''s not very dramatic or suspenseful. There''s not much depth or intellect. The premise was interesting. Perhaps the general and his descent into madness could''ve used more fleshing out. I don''t know. It feels like it''s missing something.','02-FEB-2022');
